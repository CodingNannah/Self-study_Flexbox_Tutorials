Container Properties
    Flexbox is set up on a two-axis system:
        Main & Cross
    
    Main axis is the default horizontal
        flex-start is left
        justify-content operates on main axis
            by default is flex-start
        
    Cross axis is default vertical
        flex-start is the top
        align-items operates on cross axis
            by default is stretch
            centers items to one another

    Min REQ for Container:
        justify-content
        align-items

    Flex-wrap
        default is no-wrap
        turned on (wrap) requires align-content & height

    Align-content
        aligns the group to the container

    Flex-direction
        row by default
        really only use row or column
        when column:
            requires height
            Main axis is vertical
            Cross axis is horizontal
    
    Flex-flow
        combo of flex-direction & flex-wrap
        takes TWO, ex: column wrap
        remove "flex-direction" & "flex-wrap"


Item Properties
    To flexbox-item:
    Flex-basis
        the starting point of items' width
        remove "width"

    To individ items:
    Flex-grow
        activates when above the item width
        flex-grow: 1
            grows by 1
            distributes avail space at 1:1 ratio
            if applied to all items --> evenly grows by 1 to fit avail space
        flex-grow: 2
            distributes avail space at 2:1 ratio

    Flex-shrink: 1 = grows by 1
        activates when below the item width
        flex-shrink: 1

    When using flex-basis, flex-grow, flex-shrink:
        use flex in each child
        flex: [grow] [shrink] [basis]

        flex: 1 1 15%;
        flex: 5 5 25%;
